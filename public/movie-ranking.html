<h3>1. Pride and Prejudice (2009)</h3>
<p>This is a historical fiction romance. It is based off my favorite book. This is the best version of the film.</p>
<h3>2. Lord of the Rings: Two Towers</h3>
<p>This movie is the best of the Lord of the Rings series because of the ents. I love those awesome tree dudes. One day they will find where the tree ladies went.</p>
<h3>3. Coco</h3>
<p>This is a animated movie about the day of the dead in Mexico. It is so sweet and makes me cry every time.</p>
